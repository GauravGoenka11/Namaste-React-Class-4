Please Note: Write the answers and code on your own while finishing your assignments. Try to
put down your thoughts into words by yourself in your own words. (This will help you develop

Theory Assignment:
● - What is `NPM`?
		NPM has no official name. It helps to install packages in app.
		
● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
		Parcel is package of javascript files.It is heart of react app it does many things for React like HMR,file watching, caching,bundling,minification,etc

● - What is `.parcel-cache`
		Parcel-cache is helps in caching.It does a lot of work for us like HMR,File Cahching,etc

● - What is `npx` ?
		npx is used to execute the package.
		
● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
			dependencies vs devDependencies is that dependencies installed in Production and devDependencies is used for developement purpose.
			
● - What is Tree Shaking?
		
● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
		When we save any file in our project automatically changes are reflected in the browser so it is called as Hot Module Replacement.
		
● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
	HMR,File Watcher, Create Server, Minification, Image Optimization
	HMR-Hot Module Replacement keeps track of our file and updates automically the changes in our browser.
	File Watcher--This is the algorithm that is used by HMR for keeping track of the files.It is written in C++.

● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
		.gitignore is file where we put the files/folder name that we should not be pushed to github. The files that are automatically generated that we should put in gitignore.
		Example:-node_modules,parcel_cache
		
● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
			In package.json we can see the version number. But package-lock.json keeps the track of version number.(We can see the excat verison number in package-lock.json)
			
● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
		We should not modify because it keeps the track of excat version number if we will change then it will break the synchronization between package.json and package-lock.json

● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
			Node_module is the folder where all the packages will be there which is required for react-app to run.No we should not push node_modules to github as we can regenerate it.
			
● - What is the `dist` folder?
		dist folder is development build create faster developement version of our project.

● - What is `browserlists`
		Browerlist is the dependency in node_module provided by pracel.By using browerlist we can run our app in old browers also.We have to write browerlist in package.json
